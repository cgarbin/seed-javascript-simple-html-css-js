# seed-javascript-ui-no-packages

A seed for JavaScript web client-side development without using packages,
just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The goal of this seed project is to create the basic structure of a web client
application, without making use of libraries or frameworks, and use it as starting
point for more sophisticated applications.

Covers:

- A common structure for folders (images, scripts, styles)
- The skeleton structure of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files
- Loading JavaScript, CSS and image files into the page
- Simple styling of elements with CSS
- Handling user action with JavaScript
